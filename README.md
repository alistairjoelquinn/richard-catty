## Richard Catty - Eco-conscious Writer

This is the brochure website for writer [Richard Catty](https://www.richardcatty.com/). 

Client side the application has been built with Nextjs and TypeScript. When the user first lands on the home page they are welcomed with a paragraph being typed out in front on them using [React Typist](https://github.com/jstejada/react-typist).

The hamburger menu opens the side navigation, which appears from the right. The [menu](https://github.com/alistairjoelquinn/richard-catty/blob/main/client/components/SideMenu.tsx) and the [icon](https://github.com/alistairjoelquinn/richard-catty/blob/main/client/components/HeaderIcon.tsx) are both animated using simple CSS transitions.
