## Richard Catty - Eco-conscious Writer

This is the brochure website for the writer [Richard Catty](https://www.richardcatty.com/). 

Client side the application has been built with Nextjs and TypeScript. When the user first lands on the home page they are welcomed with a paragraph being typed out in front on them using [React Typist](https://github.com/jstejada/react-typist).
